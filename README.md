## Train Catcher

Intended mainly as a proof of concept to be able to find out what trains are passing nearby.

Data from this feed might be used to do something, maybe with Home Assistant, or a digital display of some sort.

I'll probably be using the Stomp Python library to get data from [Open Rail Data](https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php?title=TD) for a given location..

Borrowing heavily off the [Open Rail Data Python sample](https://github.com/openraildata/td-trust-example-python3) it's fairly straightforward..
